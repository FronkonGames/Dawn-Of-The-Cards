The first thing a card game needs is... cards.

And why in 3D? It would be _easier_ to do it in 2D, but to have more options in terms of effects and also to differentiate myself from the rest I decided that my card game would be 3D.
differentiate myself from the rest I decided that my card game would be 3D.

For that I was going to need a 3D editor, and in my modest opinion [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is unbeatable in quality / price.
Especially if you take into account that it is free ;).

Once installed, in an empty scene, I added a plane using the menu '**Add > Mesh > Plane**'.
To make it easier to handle, I set the top camera by pressing '**7**' on the numeric pad.
