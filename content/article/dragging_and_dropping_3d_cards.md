Moving cards, with elegance.

<!--more-->

Now that I have defined [visually a card](https://fronkongames.github.io/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/article/rendering_a_card/), the next thing to do is to move it around the scene.

To do this we first have to detect the cards. We will do this using the '__Raycast__' functions, which __fire__ rays that when colliding with an object give us information about it.

Since it is a performance consuming operation, we will use some tricks to optimize it. The first one is that we will create a [layer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/use-layers.html) to discard objects that are not involved in the operation. We will named it '__DragAndDrop__'.

![Layers](/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/dragging_and_dropping_3d_cards/layers.jpg "Layers")

We will also limit the ray length to the maximum distance our camera sees, since as a general rule we are not interested in objects we are not going to see. This distance is '__Camera.main.farClipPlane__'.

Since the '__Raycast__' operation is going to be used inside the '__Update__' loop (it is going to be executed every frame), it is always a good idea to avoid allocating memory if we can avoid it. So we will create a [Ray](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Ray.html) and use the function [Physics.RaycastNonAlloc](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.RaycastNonAlloc.html).

The code to detect the cards would look something like this:

```c#
  // Layer of the objects to be detected.
  [SerializeField]
  private LayerMask raycastMask;

  // How many impacts of the beam we want to obtain.
  private const int HitsCount = 5;

  // Information on the impacts of shooting a ray.
  private readonly RaycastHit[] raycastHits = new RaycastHit[HitsCount];
  
  // Ray created from the camera to the projection of the mouse coordinates on the scene.
  private Ray mouseRay;

  /// <summary> Returns the Transfrom of the object closest to the origin of the beam. </summary>
  /// <returns>Transform or null if there is no impact.</returns>
  private Transform MouseRaycast()
  {
    Transform hit = null;

    // Fire the ray!
    if (Physics.RaycastNonAlloc(mouseRay, raycastHits, Camera.main.farClipPlane, raycastMask) > 0)
    {
      // We order the impacts according to distance.
      System.Array.Sort(raycastHits, (x, y) => x.distance.CompareTo(y.sq));

      // We are only interested in the first one.
      hit = raycastHits[0].transform;
    }

    return hit;
  }  
```
