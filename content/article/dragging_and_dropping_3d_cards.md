Moving cards, with elegance.

<!--more-->

Now that I have defined [visually a card](https://fronkongames.github.io/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/article/rendering_a_card/), the next thing to do is to move it around the scene.

To do this we first have to detect the cards. We will do this using the '**Raycast**' functions, which __fire__ rays that when colliding with an object give us information about it.

Since it is a performance consuming operation, we will use some tricks to optimize it. The first one is that we will create a [layer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/use-layers.html) to discard objects that are not involved in the operation. We will named it '__DragAndDrop__'.

![Layers](/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/dragging_and_dropping_3d_cards/layers.jpg "Layers")

We will also limit the ray length to the maximum distance our camera sees, since as a general rule we are not interested in objects we are not going to see. This distance is '__Camera.main.farClipPlane__'.

Since the '**Raycast**' operation is going to be used inside the '**Update**' loop (it is going to be executed every frame), it is always a good idea to avoid allocating memory if we can avoid it. So we will create a [Ray](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Ray.html) and use the function [Physics.RaycastNonAlloc](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.RaycastNonAlloc.html).

The code to detect the cards would look something like this:

```c#
  // Layer of the objects to be detected.
  [SerializeField]
  private LayerMask raycastMask;

  // How many impacts of the beam we want to obtain.
  private const int HitsCount = 5;

  // Information on the impacts of shooting a ray.
  private readonly RaycastHit[] raycastHits = new RaycastHit[HitsCount];
  
  // Ray created from the camera to the projection of the mouse
  // coordinates on the scene.
  private Ray mouseRay;

  /// <summary>
  /// Returns the Transfrom of the object closest to the origin
  /// of the ray.
  /// </summary>
  /// <returns>Transform or null if there is no impact.</returns>
  private Transform MouseRaycast()
  {
    Transform hit = null;

    // Fire the ray!
    if (Physics.RaycastNonAlloc(mouseRay,
                                raycastHits,
                                Camera.main.farClipPlane,
                                raycastMask) > 0)
    {
      // We order the impacts according to distance.
      System.Array.Sort(raycastHits,
                        (x, y) => x.distance.CompareTo(y.distance));


      // We are only interested in the first one.
      hit = raycastHits[0].transform;
    }

    return hit;
  }  
```

Before calling this function, we must update '__mouseRay__' with the mouse coordinates. We will do it with this code:

```c#
  mouseRay = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **In this post I will use the old [Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html) for simplicity, but it is recommended to use the new [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.4/manual/QuickStartGuide.html).** ‚ö†Ô∏è

In order to get all this to work on a card, we must first add a '[Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.html)'. Without this component, our ray would pass through the card without detecting it. A '[Box Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-BoxCollider.html)' is a good choice for the type of geometry of a card, but if you need more precision you can use a '[Mesh Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshCollider.html)'.

The second thing to do is to assign the '__layer__' we have selected to the chart. We are now ready to detect a card.

![Ray hit](/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/dragging_and_dropping_3d_cards/rayhit.gif "Ray Hit")

Now we can start moving our cards. First we are going to define two interfaces, the first one is **IDrag**, for objects that you can drag.

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Draggable object.
/// </summary>
public interface IDrag
{
  /// <summary> Can it be draggable? </summary>
  public bool IsDraggable { get; }

  /// <summary> A Drag operation is currently underway. </summary>
  public bool Dragging { get; set; }
  
  /// <summary> Mouse enters the object. </summary>
  /// <param name="position">Mouse position.</param>
  public void OnPointerEnter(Vector3 position);
  
  /// <summary> Mouse exits object. </summary>
  /// <param name="position">Mouse position.</param>
  public void OnPointerExit(Vector3 position);

  /// <summary> Drag begins. </summary>
  /// <param name="position">Mouse position.</param>
  public void OnBeginDrag(Vector3 position);

  /// <summary>A drag is being made. </summary>
  /// <param name="deltaPosition"> Mouse offset position. </param>
  /// <param name="droppable">
  /// Object on which a drop may be made, or null. </param>
  public void OnDrag(Vector3 deltaPosition, IDrop droppable);

  /// <summary> The drag operation is completed. </summary>
  /// <param name="position">Mouse position.</param>
  /// <param name="droppable">
  /// Object on which a drop may be made, or null. </param>
  public void OnEndDrag(Vector3 position, IDrop droppable);
}
```

And the second is **IDrop**, for objects that can accept IDrag objects.

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Accept draggable objects.
/// </summary>
public interface IDrop
{
  /// <summary> Is it droppable? </summary>
  public bool IsDroppable { get; }

  /// <summary> Accept an IDrag? </summary>
  /// <param name="drag">Object IDrag.</param>
  /// <returns>Accept or not the object.</returns>
  public bool AcceptDrop(IDrag drag);

  /// <summary> Performs the drop operation of an IDrag object. </summary>
  /// <param name="drag">Object IDrag.</param>
  public void OnDrop(IDrag drag);
}
```

As you can see, it is **IDrop** that will authorize an **IDrag**, with its **AcceptDrop** method, whether or not to accept a drop operation to be executed on it.

With these two interfaces ready we can start with the one in charge of handling the drag and drop operations of our cards. We can call it '**DragAndDropManager**' and will be a [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html). An operation of drag & drop operation can be divided into:

1. There is no drag operation at present.
  - Cards must be detected under the mouse pointer.
    - If a card is detected and the left mouse button is pressed, a drag operation is started and the **OnBeginDrag** method must be called.
    - If there is a detected card and no button is being pressed, the **OnPointerEnter** and **OnPointerExit** methods of the detected card are called.
2. A drag operation is in progress.
  - If the left mouse button is pressed, the card should be moved and the **OnDrag** method should be called.
  - If it is not, the drag operation must be finished and the **OnEndDrag** method must be called.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **All the code in this article is designed to move the cards in the XZ plane and use the Y axis for the height. If you use different axes you will have to modify the code.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

All this will have to be done in each frame, so it will be done inside the function '**Update**' of '**DragAndDropManager**'. We will use these variables:

```c#
// Height at which we want the card to be in a drag operation.
[SerializeField, Range(0.0f, 10.0f)]
private float height = 1.0f;

// Object to which we are doing a drag operation
// or null if no drag operation currently exists.
private IDrag currentDrag;

// IDrag objects that the mouse passes over.
private IDrag possibleDrag;

// To know the position of the drag object.
private Transform currentDragTransform;

// To calculate the mouse offset (in world-space).
private Vector3 oldMouseWorldPosition;
```

Let's see how to detect an **IDrag**.

```c#
/// <summary>Detects an IDrag object under the mouse pointer.</summary>
/// <returns>IDrag or null.</returns>
public IDrag DetectDraggable()
{
  IDrag draggable = null;

  mouseRay = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);

  Transform hit = MouseRaycast();
  if (hit != null)
  {
    draggable = hit.GetComponent<IDrag>();
    if (draggable is { IsDraggable: false })
      draggable = null;
  }

  return draggable;
}
```

Now there are two possibilities, that the left mouse button is pressed or not pressed. If it is pressed and there is an **IDrag** object under the mouse pointer:

```c#
IDrag draggable = DetectDraggable();

// Left mouse button pressed?
if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) == true)
{
  // Is there an IDrag object under the mouse pointer?
  if (draggable != null)
  {
    // We already have an object to start the drag operation!
    currentDrag = draggable;
    currentDragTransform = hit;
    oldMouseWorldPosition = MousePositionToWorldPoint();
    
    // Hide the mouse icon.
    Cursor.visible = false;
    // And we lock the movements to the window frame,
    // so we can't move objects out of the camera's view.
    Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Confined;

    // The drag operation begins.
    currentDrag.Dragging = true;
    currentDrag.OnBeginDrag(new Vector3(raycastHits[0].point.x,
                                        raycastHits[0].point.y + height,
                                        raycastHits[0].point.z));
  }
}
```

And if the left mouse button is not pressed:

```c#
// Left mouse button not pressed?
if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) == false)
{
  // We pass over a new IDrag?
  if (draggable != null && possibleDrag == null)
  {
    // We execute its OnPointerEnter.
    possibleDrag = draggable;
    possibleDrag.OnPointerEnter(raycastHits[0].point);
  }

  // We are leaving an IDrag?
  if (draggable == null && possibleDrag != null)
  {
    // We execute its OnPointerExit.
    possibleDrag.OnPointerExit(raycastHits[0].point);
    possibleDrag = null;
  }
}
```

We already have the first part, now let's go for the second part: to handle a drag operation. The first thing we will do is a new method that will return the **IDrop** that is under a card. It's not as simple as '**DetectDraggable()**', since a card has a surface and can be on several objects at once. We will need to cast four rays, one for each corner. And to choose one, we will order the
hits by proximity to the center of the card, this way we will get the **IDrop** object that is on the card and is the closest to it.

We will store the rays hits in a variable of type '[SortedSet](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.sortedset-1)' to which we will set a custom sorting function:

```c#
private class ComparerCardDistance : IComparer<Transform>
{
  public int Compare(Transform a, Transform b) => a.position.sqrMagnitude.CompareTo(b.position.sqrMagnitude);
}

private readonly SortedSet<Transform> cardHits = new(new ComparerCardDistance());
```

In '**cardHits**' will store the following function the results of rays hits:

```c#
private bool CardRaycast()
{
  Transform hit = null;
  Vector3 cardPosition = currentDragTransform.position; 

  Vector3[] cardConner =
  {
    new(cardPosition.x + cardSize.x * 0.5f, cardPosition.y, cardPosition.z - cardSize.y * 0.5f),
    new(cardPosition.x + cardSize.x * 0.5f, cardPosition.y, cardPosition.z + cardSize.y * 0.5f),
    new(cardPosition.x - cardSize.x * 0.5f, cardPosition.y, cardPosition.z - cardSize.y * 0.5f),
    new(cardPosition.x - cardSize.x * 0.5f, cardPosition.y, cardPosition.z + cardSize.y * 0.5f)
  };

  cardHits.Clear();

  for (int i = 0; i < cardConner.Length; ++i)
  {
    Ray ray = new(cardConner[i], Vector3.down);
    if (Physics.RaycastNonAlloc(ray, raycastHits, Camera.main.farClipPlane, raycastMask) > 0)
    {
      System.Array.Sort(raycastHits, (x, y) => x.distance.CompareTo(y.distance));
      hit = raycastHits[0].transform;

      if (cardHits.Contains(raycastHits[0].transform) == false)
        cardHits.Add(raycastHits[0].transform);
    }
  }

  return cardHits.Count > 0;
}
```

Let's see it in action:
