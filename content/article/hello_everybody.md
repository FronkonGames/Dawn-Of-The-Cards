This is a devblog about an indie game of **cards** and **zombies**!

<!--more-->

Hi I'm **Martin Bustos** and I've been developing games for more than two decades for PC, consoles, online, etc (you can check the list in my [GitHub](https://github.com/FronkonGames) profile). I've worked in several videogame companies and even co-founded two of them.

I recently decided to leave the corporate environment and dedicate myself to making games that I feel like making and playing! Here I will be recording the progress of my first game as an indie developer: '**Dawn Of The Cards**', a card and zombie game.

The game engine will be [Unity](https://unity.com/) and I will build a modular framework to use it in future projects. This framework, which I've called '**Game:Work**', is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/FronkonGames) and consists of two parts:

* [Foundation](https://github.com/FronkonGames/GameWork-Foundation): a set of utilities and tools, without any architecture (so you could just use it in your projects).
* [Core](https://github.com/FronkonGames/GameWork-Core): a modular architecture, based on events and dependency injection.

My intention is also to make open source modules as I need them, such as [Local Data](https://github.com/FronkonGames/GameWork-Local-Data) which is in charge of saving and loading data in the user's device, or the [Tween](https://github.com/FronkonGames/GameWork-Tween) module.

Until next time... **stay gamedev, stay awesome!**
