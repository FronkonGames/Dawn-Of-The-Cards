Current subscribers will receive an offer to upgrade to the &lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo; plan for <strong>one year</strong> at the &lsquo;<strong>Unity Plus</strong>&rsquo; price.</li><li>Pricing plans will be &lsquo;<strong>Unity Personal</strong>&rsquo; (free<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>), &lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo; (~$2000/year/seat) and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>&rsquo; (?) (the &lsquo;<strong>Unity Industry</strong>&rsquo; plan is not mentioned).</li><li>The &lsquo;<strong>Unity Runtime Fee</strong>&rsquo;, a charge for each installation of the game billed monthly, is introduced.</li></ul><h1 id=unity-runtime-fee>Unity Runtime Fee</h1><p>The &lsquo;<strong>Unity Runtime Fee</strong>&rsquo; is a fee to be paid by the developer for each installation of his game made with Unity. <strong>BOTH</strong> conditions must be met for this to apply:</p><ul><li>Your game exceeds a certain <strong>number of installations</strong>.</li><li>Your <strong>net income</strong> in the last twelve months exceeds a certain number.</li></ul><p>Only when <strong>both conditions</strong> are met, this payment applies. And only for installations that exceed the limit number of installations. If you only exceed the limit in one installation, you would only pay for that extra installation.</p><p>The limit of installations depends on the plan you have:</p><ul><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Personal</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Plus</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>200000</strong>.</li><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>1000000</strong>.</li></ul><p>The same as the net income limit:</p><ul><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Personal</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Plus</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>$200,000</strong> (USD).</li><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>$1,000,000</strong> (USD).</li></ul><p>And finally, if you meet these two conditions, the price to pay for installation will depend on the country where it is installed. If it is <strong>not from an &lsquo;<em>emerging market</em>&rsquo;</strong><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Personal</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Plus</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>$0.20</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>With &lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo; will depend on each new installation, which exceeds the limit, per month:<ul><li>000001 - 100000: <strong>$0.15</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>100001 - 500000: <strong>$0.075</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>500001 - 1000000: <strong>$0.03</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>1000001+: <strong>$0.02</strong> (USD) per new install.</li></ul></li><li>With &lsquo;<strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>&rsquo;, will depend on each new installation, which exceeds the limit, per month:<ul><li>000001 - 100000: <strong>$0.125</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>100001 - 500000: <strong>$0.06</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>500001 - 1000000: <strong>$0.02</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>1000001+: <strong>$0.01</strong> (USD) per new install.</li></ul></li></ul><p>If the installation occurs in a &lsquo;<em>emerging market</em>&rsquo;<sup id=fnref1:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Personal</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Plus</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>$0.02</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>$0.01</strong> (USD) per new install.</li><li>&lsquo;<strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>&rsquo;: <strong>$0.005</strong> (USD) per new install.</li></ul><p>Finally, some exceptions. The &lsquo;<strong>Unity Runtime Fee</strong>&rsquo; will not be paid for games that:</p><ul><li>Use WebGL or streaming.</li><li>Games using gaming subscription services.</li><li>Charity bundles.</li><li>Reinstalls of the same game, on the same device (on different devices, <strong>counts as a new installation</strong>).</li><li>Pirate installations or &lsquo;<em>install bombing</em>&rsquo; (how Unity will detect this is a mystery).</li><li>Demos of games that do not have the complete content (<em>early access</em> are not considered demos).</li><li>Subscription-based games as Apple Arcade, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, etc (Unity plans to be paid by the service?).</li></ul><p>You are also eligible for a price reduction if you use Unity services such as &lsquo;<a href=https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services>Unity Gaming Services</a>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<a href=https://unity.com/unity-ads-ironsource>Unity LevelPlay</a>&rsquo;.</p><p>It&rsquo;s all very simple, isn&rsquo;t it?

Shares that today are worth -47% of their original <a href=https://venturebeat.com/business/unity-technologies-raises-more-than-1-1-billion-in-ipo-at-12-1-billion-valuation/>IPO</a> value.</p><p><img src=/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/unity_is_a_harsh_mistress/stocks.jpg alt=Stocks title=Stocks></p><p>And not only the community is pissed, but also the Unity engineers, whose superiors don&rsquo;t seem to care much about what they think:</p><p><img src=/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/unity_is_a_harsh_mistress/employee.jpg alt=Employee title=Employee></p><h1 id=how-it-affects-us>How it affects us</h1><p>If you use Unity, the situation is worrying. But not for the reasons you think. The &lsquo;<strong>Unity Runtime Fee</strong>&rsquo; will negatively affect:</p><blockquote><h1 id=free-games-with-a-very-low-arpuhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiaverage_revenue_per_user><strong>Free games with a very low <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user>ARPU</a></strong></h1></blockquote><p>Or to put it another way, F2P with only advertising revenue. Is it a coincidence that if you use &lsquo;<a href=https://unity.com/unity-ads-ironsource>Unity LevelPlay</a>&rsquo; (formerly <a href=https://unity.com/unity-ads-ironsource>Iron Source</a>), Unity&rsquo;s advertising service, you can receive a discount on &lsquo;<strong>Unity Runtime Fee</strong>&rsquo;? 🤔</p><p>Is this an attempt to kill <a href=https://www.applovin.com/>AppLovin</a>? 🤔</p><p>Does it have anything to do with AppLovin trying to <a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/applovin-abandons-effort-to-buy-unity-after-20-billion-bid-rejected.html>buy Unity for $20 billion</a>? 🤔</p><p>What does the CEO of AppLovin <a href=https://www.applovin.com/blog/my-views-on-the-unity-price-change/>think about this</a>? 🤔</p><p>Whatever Unity&rsquo;s reasons are for this change, I really believe that the vast majority of developers will not be affected. For those that do, many will still pay less than if they were using <a href=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/faq>Unreal Engine</a> (which has no royalties up to $1000000, after that you pay 5%).</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see it with these graphs<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>, first for using &lsquo;<strong>Unity Personal</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Unity Plus</strong>&rsquo;:</p><p><img src=/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/unity_is_a_harsh_mistress/plus.png alt=Plus title=Plus></p><p>And this one for &lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo;.</p><p><img src=/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/unity_is_a_harsh_mistress/pro.png alt=Pro title=Pro></p><ul><li>Most of us are in the 0% zone (according to Unity about 90%) 🥲.</li><li>If you earn more than $200,000 net, it makes sense for you to upgrade to the &lsquo;<strong>Unity Pro</strong>&rsquo; plan.</li><li>If you are in the 0% to 5% zone, and you are not thinking about developing your own technology or using <a href=https://godotengine.org/>open source alternatives</a>, it is not worth changing if you are happy with Unity.</li><li>If you are outside the above zones, evaluate the costs of migrating your technology or creating your own. Perhaps you should also evaluate your business model.</li></ul><h1 id=my-conclusions>My conclusions</h1><p><img src=/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/images/dragging_and_dropping_3d_cards/promo.gif alt=game title=game></p><p>I have been using Unity <a href=https://github.com/FronkonGames>professionally</a> since version 4. With Unity I have developed games for PC, mobile and consoles. I&rsquo;ve been <a href=https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/62716>selling assets in their store</a> for almost 10 years.</p><p>I have co-founded several game companies and as CTO I have chosen Unity as our technology. I&rsquo;m even <a href=https://fronkongames.github.io/Dawn-Of-The-Cards/>developing a game</a> right now using Unity.</p><p><strong>I like Unity</strong> for being able to use C#, the customization of its Editor, its asset store, the speed of prototyping and its huge community.</p><p>But I would say <strong>Unity is a harsh mistress</strong>, especially after its IPO.
